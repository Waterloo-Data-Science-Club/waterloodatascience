# UW DSC Website

This repo holds the Jekyll code for the new DSC website that will host: info about the club, our blog, and an ongoing knowledge repo for students interested in data science.

## Installation

Want to contribute? Download the appropriate [Ruby installation for your OS](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

Once you're done that, follow these terminal instructions:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
git clone https://github.com/joannalu97/waterloodatascience
cd waterloodatascience
bundle install
```
You can then view your site locally by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

#### Mobile Testing

If you're doing mobile testing and your browsers dev tools aren't cutting it, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0`. This will bind your Jekyll server to all available IPs. On local wifi you can then access the site on your phone via [your computer's IP address](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) and the port number (for example: `192.168.1.109:4000`).
