Our mission is to create a platform for discussion of topics related to Data Science as well as create a network of support for learning and job search.

This is our first blog post. Our intent is that this new site will be a place where students can read blog posts from other students, as well as be a repository for all the talks and resources we provide.

Here's some demonstrations of code highlighting and images:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1) 
y = np.sin(x) 
plt.title("sine wave form") 

plt.plot(x, y) 
plt.show() 
```
